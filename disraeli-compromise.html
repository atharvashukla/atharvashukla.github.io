<h1>Disraeli compromise</h1>

<p>As Benjamin Disraeli rose to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he learned to give up vengeance. However, he retained an outlet for resentment by writing the names of all the people
    who
    wronged him on a piece of paper and placing it in a drawer.</p>

<p>Then, from time to time, he reviewed these names and took pleasure in noting the way the world had taken his enemies down without his assistance</p>
